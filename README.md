# Project 2 -- The Final Project

This project has a few `sorry`s for you to fill in.  It is designed to
be a bit more open-ended than the homework, but less open-ended than
the midterm project.  You'll have a chance, for instance, to pick the
function `f` that you are working with.

Projects must include both code and a short write-up explaining the
approach you have taken, issues you faced, how you overcame said
issues.

Scores will be based on the quality of the project's code, and the
clarity of the written explanation.  This is meant to be a dialogue,
so if you have questions, please share your preliminary work with
fowler@math.osu.edu to receive early feedback.
